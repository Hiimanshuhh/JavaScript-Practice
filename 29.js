/*
  Increment
  In programming, you often want to increase or decrease a counter by one. This can easily be done with the increment or decrement 
  operator.
  let x = 1;
  x++;
  let y = 10;
  y--;
  x++ is the same as x = x + 1 and y-- is the same as y = y - 1. After executing the example code, x has the value 2 and y has the 
  value 9.

  Exercise
  Which value does x have after execution of the following code?
  let x = 3;
  x++;
  x = x * 2;
  x--;
