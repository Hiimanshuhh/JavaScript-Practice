  Numbers
  Numbers are represented by simple numerals. They can have a decimal point and a minus sign.
  let x1 = 1;
  let x2 = 1.0;
  let x3 = 3.14;
  let x4 = -1;
  1 and 1.0 are the same number. You can calculate with numbers. The four basic arithmetics adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing are represented by + - * and /.
  let x1 = 6;
  let x2 = 2;
  let x3 = x1 + x2;
  let x4 = x1 - x2;
  let x5 = x1 * x2;
  let x6 = x1 / x2;
  The variables x3 to x6 thus have the values 8, 4, 12 and 3.

  Exercise
  Write a function add that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

  Example: add(1, 2) should return 3.
*/
function add(num1, num2){
  return num1+num2;
  }
  add(1,2);
